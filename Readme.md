# MongoDB: Non-Relational Database
* MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.

## Queries:

1. Show all the Databases: ***Query: show dbs;***
2. Create a Database: ***Query:Use Guvizenclass;***


3. Create a 7 collection names:
    
    * Users
    * Attendance
    * Codekata
    * Tasks
    * Topics
    * Company Drives
    * Mentors

4. Using this Aggregation:
    
    * Lookup
    * Match
    * Projection
    * Unwind
    * Count
